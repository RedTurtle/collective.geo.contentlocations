Changelog
=========

0.2 (unreleased)

* Updated geo shape form to exclude the geopoint Javascript which was
  causing the old marker actions to be applied to the map widget.
  [rockdj]
* Manage coordinates form now redirects to the the View action for
  certain types of content specified in the site properties.  This
  includes types such as File and Image where redirecting to their normal
  absolute URL would prompt the user to download said content.
  [rockdj]
* added Shapely package in install_requiries

  coordinate order to be [longitude, latitude] rather than [latitude,
  longitude].

* Updated unit tests to check for error message on CSV upload as well
  as updated coordinates.
  [rockdj]
